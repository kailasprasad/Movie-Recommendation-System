# Movie-Recommendation-System (KAIBURR SELECTION TASK 6- DESIGN A ML MODEL OF A PROBLEM STATEMENT OF YOUR CHOICE)
A ML model using NLTK library and Cosine Similarity from ScikitLearn that can recommend movies similar to the user given movie name.

PROBLEM STATEMENT-

A movie recommendation system project in machine learning has many uses, including:

1) Personalization:- One of the main uses of a movie recommendation system is to personalize the movie recommendations for each user based on their viewing history, preferences, and ratings. This helps to improve the user experience and increase engagement.

2) Marketing: Movie recommendation systems can also be used by streaming services and OTT platforms for marketing purposes.

3) Revenue generation: By recommending movies that users are likely to enjoy, movie recommendation systems can increase revenue for streaming services and movie studios by encouraging users to watch more movies and sign up for premium subscriptions.

4) Better user experience: By providing accurate and relevant recommendations, movie recommendation systems can improve the overall user experience and make it easier for users to find movies that they will enjoy.

This project takes a movie name as an input and recommends you some movies like the input movie based on similarity between them. It also shows you information about input movie and the details of actors.

COSINE SIMILARITY :- 
The Scikit-learn library provides the "cosine_similarity" function to calculate the cosine similarity between two arrays. This function takes two arrays as input and returns a matrix of cosine similarity scores.
